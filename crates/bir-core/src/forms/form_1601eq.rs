//! BIR Form 1601-EQ — Quarterly Remittance Return of Creditable Income Taxes
//! Withheld (Expanded), January 2018 (ENCS).
//!
//! Ported from the official `BIR-Form1601EQ.hta` (eBIRForms 7.9.6.2.1): the
//! ATC popup (`changedrpATCList` / `getATCCode` / `changeATCRate`), the
//! compute chain (`getRequiredWithheld` … `computeOfTotalAmtDue`),
//! `validateForm` with its exact alert texts, and `saveXMLsubmit`.
//!
//! The official page builds part of what it submits at run time, so the
//! generated layout (`data/official-xml/1601eq-v2018.json`, taken from the
//! static page) lacks it. [`Form1601EqDraft::official_layout`] adds those
//! controls at the places the page puts them in `frmMain`:
//! - Items 13–18 (`txtAtcCd1..6`, `txtTaxBase`, `txtTaxRate`,
//!   `txtTaxbeWithHeld`), drawn by `populateAtcPart2()` at load and redrawn by
//!   `getATCCode()`, right after `txtEmail`;
//! - the popup's ATC checkboxes (`AtcCode1..n`), drawn when Item 11 is
//!   answered, right before `hPartIITableSize`;
//! - "Other Selected ATC" rows 7+ (more than six ATCs), right after
//!   `hPartIITableSize`.
