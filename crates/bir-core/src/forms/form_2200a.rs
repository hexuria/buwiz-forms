//! BIR Form 2200A — Excise Tax Return for Alcohol Products (January 2020).
//!
//! Ported from the official `BIR-Form2200Av2020.hta` (eBIRForms 7.9.6.2.1):
//! the per-row tax due (`computeField`: applicable tax rate × taxable base,
//! formatted by `amtFormat`, i.e. JavaScript `toFixed(2)`), the Schedule 1
//! total (`calculate_Sched1_TotalDue`), Part III (`calculate_Part3`),
//! `validateForm` with its exact alert texts, the "Others" row checks of
//! `isValidDataOnSched1`, and `saveXMLsubmit` through [`crate::official_xml`].
//!
//! Schedule 1 is a fixed list of 60 product/period rows; each row's rate
//! sits in the page as `<td id="…_ATR" value="…">`, which the official
//! engine (mshta, IE7 document mode) exposes as `td.value`. Three "Others"
//! rows take filer-typed ATC digits, description, bracket, rate and tax due.
//! The page can append more "Others" rows, but those are not part of the
//! official submit layout, so the model stops at three.
//!
//! Profile values (name, address) are submitted as loaded; nothing on the
//! submit path uppercases them.
