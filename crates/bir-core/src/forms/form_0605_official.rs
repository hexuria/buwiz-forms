//! Form 0605 (Payment Form, July 1999) on the generic submission path.
//!
//! Ported from the official `BIR-Form0605.hta` (eBIRForms 7.9.6.2.1): the
//! compute chain (`computePenalties`, `computeOfTax`), the Item 6 / Item 8
//! popups (`TaxTypeCodeList`, `ATCList`, `getATCCode`, `getTaxTypeCode`),
//! `validate()` / `initialValidateBeforeSave()` with their exact alert texts,
//! and `saveXMLsubmit` through [`crate::official_xml`].
//!
//! The official layout is the page as it is written in the HTA. When the
//! page loads it adds one `TaxTypeCode<n>` radio per Item 8 tax type, and
//! choosing a tax type adds one `AtcCode<n>` radio per Item 6 ATC; all of
//! them sit in the form just before `txtFinalFlag`, so `saveXMLsubmit`
//! writes them there. [`QueueableForm::official_payload`] adds them the same
//! way.
