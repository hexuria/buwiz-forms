//! BIR Form 1601-FQ — Quarterly Remittance Return of Final Income Taxes
//! Withheld, January 2018 (ENCS).
//!
//! Ported from the official `BIR-Form1601FQ.hta` (eBIRForms 7.9.6.2.1): the
//! ATC popup (`changedrpATCList` / `getATCCode`), Schedule 1 (treaty rates,
//! `getATCdrpTaxRate` / `getReqWithheldCompute`), the compute chain
//! (`computeofTotalWithheldTax`), `validate()` with its exact alert texts,
//! and `saveXMLsubmit`.
//!
//! The page draws part of what it submits at run time, so the generated
//! layout (`data/official-xml/1601fq-v2018.json`, from the static page) lacks
//! it. [`Form1601FqDraft::official_layout`] adds those controls where the page
//! puts them in `frmMain`:
//! - Items 14–19 (`txtAtcCode1..6`, `txtTaxBase`, `txtTaxRate`,
//!   `txtTaxbeWithHeld`), drawn by `populateAtcPart2()` at load and redrawn by
//!   `getATCCode()`, right after `drpSpecialTax`;
//! - the popup's ATC checkboxes (`AtcCd1..n`, plus the "N/A" special-law row
//!   `enableSelTreaty()` appends when Item 13 is "Yes") and the "Other Selected
//!   ATC" rows 7+, right before `txtFinalFlag`.
