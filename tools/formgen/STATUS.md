# STATUS — formgen, measured state

**Update rule: any commit that moves a number below updates this file in the
same commit.** This is the only formgen document allowed to hold measured
status numbers (`GOAL.md` owns that rule; `README.md` owns the process).

Measured 2026-08-06 at HEAD `1dc9c87`, over the 53-form corpus. Gate verdicts
are from run **r8**, a complete clean-tree run at these exact producer bytes.
Assertion counts are from a corpus-wide `audit.py --assertions-only`; the
findings tally is recomputed from `review-findings.json`.

**9 of 12 PASS. Identical to r7 and r6, check for check and count for count.**
The determinism digest moved (`5061598cbb20` → `5867ca1f9d5a`) because
`1dc9c87` added `page_papers` to every `provenance.json`; both regenerations
agreed.

**No r9 was run, and this is deliberate.** The comb-divider increment that r9
was to measure applied **no producer change** (see below), so the working tree
is byte-identical to the one r8 scored: same commit, clean tree, and all four
producer files still match the referee's pins
(`lattice` `9aeedba0`, `audit` `7c902be9`, `extract` `5f75f191`,
`verify` `8dbeb222`). All 10 module self-tests were re-run at these bytes and
pass, matching r8's `10 modules pass`. A gate run is a deterministic function
of those bytes, so r9 could only reproduce r8 at a 60-minute cost.

## Comb dividers lost to stroke caps (this increment — diagnosis only, no code change)

The user's complaint is that a fillable box does not occupy the printed box.
The measured instance: 2550M item 1's YYYY group prints **four** compartments,
but `p1c2` (x 208.56–270.72) emits **one** free-text input. It still does —
`kind: "field"`, no comb — because this increment changed no code.

**The tolerance fix proposed for it was refused, and refusing it was correct.**
The proposal was to make `lattice.supported_at` (lattice.py:183-187) apply
`CLUSTER_TOL_PT` on the y axis as it already does on x. Measured over the
corpus, a symmetric 0.30 flips 138 borders to combs **and 45 combs to borders**,
and does not fix 2550M anyway: its gap is 0.36. The gap histogram has a dead
zone — 0.01/0.09/0.10/0.12/0.18/0.25, then nothing until 0.34/0.35/0.36 — so no
threshold both reaches 0.36 and avoids comb→border flips (even 0.01 flips 37).
The legitimacy test in the brief is also unmet: the x test compares a point
against a horizontal's **length** endpoints, the y test against its
**thickness** band — different classes of measurement. lattice's own precedent
for y-support slack is `supported_near`, which uses `JOIN_EPSILON_PT` (0.05).

**The real cause is in extract.py, and it needs no tolerance at all.** Verified
against the pinned source (`bir2550m.pdf`, sha256 `9fb4101a…`, matching
`provenance.json`): the three ticks are stroked with `lineCap = (1,1,1)` —
**round** — at width 0.72. A round cap paints half the line width past each
path endpoint, so the ticks' real painted extent is y 99.24–102.84, and h4's
ink top edge is **exactly** 102.84. The strokes touch; the 0.36 "gap" is an
artefact of reading the path instead of the ink.

extract.py never consults the cap: there is no `lineCap`/`J` reference in the
file. Its stroke-to-rect conversion applies `half = width / 2.0` to the
**thickness** axis only — visible in the IR, where v177 spans x 223.08–223.80
(0.72 wide, half-width each side of 223.44) while its y stays the bare path
99.60–102.48. The two sites are extract.py:382 (`re` ops) and extract.py:1571
(`l` ops — the one that draws these ticks), where `near`/`far` get `half` and
`start`/`end` get raw `min`/`max`.

The fix is to extend a stroke's **length** by `width/2` when `lineCap` is 1
(round) or 2 (projecting square), and not at all for 0 (butt). That is
honouring the official geometry rather than relaxing a check — strictly more
faithful, form-code-agnostic, and it makes the 2550M contact exact instead of
approximate. It is a producer change to extract.py, so it re-pins
`AUDIT_DEPENDENCY_SHA256` and invalidates every downstream digest.

Not yet measured: how many of the 626 both-endpoints-unsupported borders have a
round or projecting cap, and therefore how far this moves
`comb_slots_match_printed`. That is the next increment's first measurement.

## The comb writing surface (previous increment)

`lattice.comb_bands` published the divider **tick** band as the comb's own
vertical extent. The tick is a guide mark under the writing box, not the box:
on 2550M's item-4 TIN row the cell walls span the full 15.60pt of the row
while the digit separators are 3.12pt stubs along its bottom edge.
`comb_writing_surface` now reports the owning cell's printed walls inset by the
cell's own border thicknesses, the same inset `emit.field_box` gives a plain
text field. The tick band stays published as `divider_band_y0`/`y1`/
`height_pt`.

| Measured over `build/layout` | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comb cells with a writing box under half their own cell | 4,474 of 4,522 | **0** |
| comb cells with a writing box outside their own cell | 225 | **0** |
| 2550M `p1c9` (item-4 TIN) slot height, in a 15.60pt cell | 3.12pt | **14.16pt** |
| 2550M `p1c9` fitted face | 2.81pt | **8.25pt** (the sheet's modal body size) |

The change is vertical only, and the regenerated bytes prove it: 0 slot counts,
0 pitches and 0 slot X positions moved anywhere in the corpus, and no comb count
moved on any bundle, so `EXPECTED_COMBS_BY_SLUG` needed no re-pin.

## Failing assertions (corpus-wide `--assertions-only`)

| Assertion | r6 forms / offenders | r7 forms / offenders | Movement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inputs_over_printed_text` | 40 / 239 | 40 / **258** | **worse by 19 offenders**, same 40 forms |
| `comb_slots_match_printed` | 22 / 186 | 22 / 186 | unchanged, identical form set |
| `money_boxes_have_inputs` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |
| `rules_below_guide_cut` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |
| `run_colour_matches_ir` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |
| `reflow_rate_without_description` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |
| `image_transform_applied` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |
| `no_invented_codepoints` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | holds |

**`inputs_over_printed_text` got worse, and it is the writing-surface fix that
did it.** 17 comb cells newly overlap a printed run and 1 stopped; every one of
the 24 new offender records is a comb cell, and the overlapped runs are the
captions those cells carry in their upper half (`2316-2021` p1c27-30 "Date of
Birth"/"(MM/DD/YYYY)", `2551m-2002` p1c76/81/88 "28C"/"29B"/"30C",
`2553-1999` p1c71/76/83, `2550m-2007` p1c91-93 "Debit Memo",
`1604cf-2008` p1c16/21 "Telephone No."/"Zip Code", `1600wp-2010` p1c24,
`1701ms-2024` p1c183).

The cause is real and is named rather than absorbed: in those cells the lattice
rectangle spans caption **and** comb (e.g. `2551m-2002` p1c76 is 18.65pt tall
with its ticks in the bottom 2.88pt), so "the whole cell inset by its borders"
reaches text that the 3.12pt band never touched. Both readings are wrong for
these cells; the new one is wrong in the direction where a taxpayer can
actually type. No gate verdict changed on it — the check failed on 40 forms
before and after — but the offender count is a debt, and the fix belongs in
lattice.py's cell segmentation, not in relaxing the assertion.

## Findings ledger (`review-findings.json`, 138 findings)

| Severity | Open | Resolved |
| --- | --- | --- |
| blocker | 5 | 16 |
| major | 21 | 42 |
| minor | 36 | 4 |
| cosmetic | 12 | 2 |

The gate counts blocker+major only: **26 open of 84**, unchanged this
increment.

## Comb referee — still UNEVALUABLE, still user-blocked

`EXPECTED_HTML_STRUCTURE_SHA256`'s 53 reviewed pins remain stale and were **not**
touched: re-pinning them is a user-review action (see `GOAL.md` `## Blocked`).
The producer pins that *are* an agent's to maintain were refreshed in `8df82e7`:
`LATTICE_PRODUCER_SHA256` for the writing-surface change, and
`HTML_RUNTIME_SCRIPT_SHA256` from a 2-tuple to a 3-tuple for the appended
`?debug=fields` overlay — the first two hashes byte-identical, which is the
evidence the overlay changed no shipped behaviour.

### Open integration question for the referee (not acted on)

`comb_referee.classify_band` reads `comb["y0"]/["y1"]` as the **source divider
band** — it seeds the open-compartment search and the attached-external-band
retry from them. `emitted_geometry_contract` reads the same two keys as the
**emitted writing box**, which is what emit.py lays out. One field now answers
two different questions. The emission side stays correct automatically; the
source side should read `divider_band_y0`/`divider_band_y1`, which lattice.py
publishes for exactly this purpose.

This was deliberately **not** changed here: the referee is the adjudicator, and
editing its derivation in the same increment as the producer change it
adjudicates is the pattern `GOAL.md`'s user decision 1 forbids. It is inert
today because the check is already UNEVALUABLE on the blocked HTML pins, but it
must be settled before the referee can score again.

## CI

Unchanged since the last measurement: the formgen job went green for the first
time on 2026-08-05 (run 31040386488). The commits in this increment have not
yet been through a CI cycle.

## Open issues, diagnosed

| Issue | State | Root cause / residual | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inputs_over_printed_text`: 40 forms / 258 offenders | worse by 19 this increment | 17 new offenders are comb cells whose lattice rectangle spans caption + comb, so the full-height writing surface reaches the caption. Residual populations A/B1/C1/C2 per the 2026-08 triage are unchanged. | `lattice.py` cell segmentation |
| `comb_slots_match_printed`: 22 forms / 186 offenders | unchanged | `printed_compartments` reads only the cell rectangle and no member of the lattice `comb` object, which is why a vertical-only change cannot move it. Residual: the still-refused U-frame-crop / corridor-absorb topologies plus genuine geometry defects. | `audit.py` topology chooser |
| Comb dividers filed as borders (2550M `p1c2` = 1 input where 4 print) | diagnosed, not fixed | extract.py ignores `lineCap`, so a round-capped tick's ink (which reaches its baseline exactly) is recorded 0.36pt short and `supported_at` correctly finds no support. Widening the tolerance was measured, refuted and refused. | `extract.py` stroke-to-rect (382, 1571) |
| comb-referee UNEVALUABLE | user-blocked | 53 reviewed HTML structure pins stale; plus the `classify_band` source/emission key collision above. | user review, then `comb_referee.py` |
| findings: 26 blocker+major open | unchanged | comb capacity (referee track), inputs-over-text populations, guide-cut orphan policy, text mis-position, individual re-verifications | per-cause owners |
